# demoweb
Boilerplate webapp project scaffolding based on Spring 2x and Angular 6x. The project demonstrates the use of making a simple ajax request to a secure API on the server. A dummy token is passed in the request header as required by the Secure API to authenticate the client. The API in response returns a plain text message which is then parsed and displayed on the home page.
